# Challenge

This project has two goals :
- Make a prediction of a number of bikes in a given day and time. 
- Create an animation or a widget which represents the bike traffic in Montpellier

## Prediction

For this part, we have to predict the number of bicycles passing between 00:01 AM and 09:00 AM on Friday, April 2nd. To help us, we will use an existing dataset :

## Visualization

For the visualization part, we have to do an animation or a widget of the bike traffic in Montpellier using the data from the multiples bike counter that can be found at the following link :
